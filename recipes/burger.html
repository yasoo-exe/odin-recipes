    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of
      fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a
      sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese,
      lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as
      ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a
      variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame
      seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a
      cheeseburger.[1]
