    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other
      national varieties),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2] french-fried
      potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut[3] deep-fried
      potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They are prepared by
      cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually
      in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely
      used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are
      small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.
