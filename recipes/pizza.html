      Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan:
      [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
      base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies,
      mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
      baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1]
